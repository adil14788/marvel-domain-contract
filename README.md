## Hardhat

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks for testing the contract :

```shell
npm install 
npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js
```
